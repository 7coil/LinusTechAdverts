So it's not always that our sponsors tie so perfectly into our content but today it happened.

Today's sponsor is Rackspace - the top tier managed cloud computing company; they pride themselves on best-in-class service across all platforms; they've got over 300,000 customers in 120 countries with 10 worldwide data centers; they've got Red Hat, Cisco, Microsoft, VMware certifications - and all of that amounts to whether you're running a small business or a billion dollar enterprise; whatever your needs are in terms of capacity storage or flash-based high performance storage they can take care of it without you going grey or bald because you did something wrong and screwed up a backup and went and lost a RAID array or whatever else.

They've got dedicated storage to meet your performance, security, network capacity and compliance needs. Everything from direct-attached storage so that gives you the flexibility and scalability of just a simple "Ok let's attach some drives to this thing, it's redundant, cool, off you go to the races" to SAN - so that's high availability and reliability, fully redundant for business, to even NAS with support for demanding workloads like virtualization, file sharing and rich media - in fact their NAS stuff can scale up to 20 petabytes of capacity.

They've got public cloud and private cloud options as well and you can get your own server a scaleable private cloud in the data center, in your data center, in their data center and it's all supported by Rackspace and VMware. They call their support "fanatical" because these people are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year and they've got industry-leading service level agreements both managed and intensive - so if you need dedicated storage, they got you covered go to `rackspace.com/ltt` to learn more... and not go through what I did.
