Speaking of cold dead fingers, dbrand... is going to kill me when they see this segway 

Dbrand skins are a way to not just have your device look beter but also to take care of it because they can help protect from incidental scuffs and scratches.

One of the coolest things about dbrand is when you go on their website and select your device, you can preview it in realtime exactly what its going to look like
so you dont just have to go okay I want yellow here or I want you know carbon-fiber there or this absolutely sick man I LOVE this honeycomb finish they sent over on 
the S10 and S10 plus

You can mix and math things if your into that kind of thing and create EXACTLY the look you want. They offer cheap international shipping and you can check then out at the link
in the video discription. (https://dbrand.com/LinusDropTips)
