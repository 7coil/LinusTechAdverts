Woah hey there kids!

I'm Linus, and I'm here to tell you about TunnelBear!

TunnelBear is the easy, fast and safe _ok I'm holding up my fingers_
easy, fast and safe way to secure your internet connection from your ISP or advertisers or anyone who's looking to profit from your browsing habits and your data. It's easy to turn on - all you got to do is download it for your platform of choice - PC, Mac, Android, iOS, and you basically press the button and \*boom\* - your connection gets encrypted and you can use online services that are geo-restricted! _That's right kids! Geo-restricted online services!_ As though you are in that country.

But don't take my word for it. I have a free 7-day trial at `tunnelbear.com/ltt`
