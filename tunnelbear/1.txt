TunnelBear is the easy-to-use VPN that keeps your internet connection private from your internet service provider, whoever runs that sketchy cafe with the free Wi-Fi or advertisers who want to profit off of your browsing data. Enabling TunnelBear is simple: it's available for PC, Mac, iOS, Android - there's even a Chrome extension; you just press the button and \*boom\*! Your connection gets encrypted and you appear to the online services you're using as though you are some random in some random place - it's almost like you're wearing a mask.

So start a 7-day free trial over at `tunnelbear.com/ltt` and keep your browsing private.
