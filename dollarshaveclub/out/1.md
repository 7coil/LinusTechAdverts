Speaking of... things Dollar Shave Club!

Dollar Shave Club is a great way to get razors and other bathroom supplies shipped directly to your door, for only a few bucks a month.
The razors are high-quality and we have a ton of community members who use them every day and love the smooth shape that they get, no matter how thick or coarse their facial hair may be.

For some reason this comes as a shock to many people out there - but yes even though I have facial hair I do shave, and I would definitely say that I get a better shape from Dollar Shave Club razors than those old ones that I had. The razors are pretty darn nice and on top of that, their razors also come with Dr. Carver's shave butter which goes on smooth so you can see what you're doing and they're peppermint scented butt wipes for men - for those of you over here in North America that can't get your hands on a bidet.

So check out everything they have to offer at `dollarshaveclub.com/linus`
